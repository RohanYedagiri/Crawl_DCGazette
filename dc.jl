Just as obviously, virtually all Americans today wish that slavery had never existed. It\u2019s a part of America\u2019s heritage that is clearly at odds with America\u2019s founding principles.", "That does not mean, however, that the Constitution and its presidential election process are simply a \u201crelic of slavery.\u201d The discussions at the Constitutional Convention were shaped more by the delegates\u2019 study of history and political philosophy, as well as their own experiences with Parliament and the state legislatures. They wanted to avoid the mistakes that had been made in other governments. They sought to establish a better constitution that would stand the test of time.", "George Washington expressed this conviction, felt so strongly by the founding generation: \u201c[T]he preservation of the sacred fire of liberty, and the destiny of the Republican model of government,\u201d he concluded, \u201care justly considered as deeply, perhaps as finally staked, on the experiment entrusted to the hands of the American people.\u201d", "His words echoed an argument that James Madison had made about a year and a half earlier.

The Constitution met these criteria.", "Nevertheless, some modern commentators brush this history aside and insist that the compromises at the convention were nothing more than attempts to preserve slavery. Americans, they say, have been fooled into thinking that their heritage is more admirable than it is. The specific charges about the Electoral College in this context are inaccurate, but they need to be addressed since they are raised so often.", "First, critics sometimes cite the Constitution\u2019s \u201cthree-fifths\u201d compromise, which determined how slaves would be counted in apportioning congressional representation. The South wanted to count each slave as a whole person. The North did not want to count slaves at all\u2014a larger population would give the South more voting power. In the end, convention delegates agreed to count each slave as three-fifths of a person.", "But did that compromise really do more for the South or for the North?", "If slaves had been counted as whole persons (as the South wanted), then the South would have had even more representatives in Congress. In other words, while the three-fifths compromise is often cited as an advantage for the slave-holding South, it can also be interpreted as a win for the North.", "One additional nuance complicates an assessment of the three-fifths compromise\u2014the convention applied the same formula for apportioning direct taxes. The North effectively offered the South a compromise: In return for having fewer representatives in Congress, the South would be assessed less in federal taxes.", "A more honest assessment of the three-fifths compromise shows what it really concerned\u2014congressional representation and taxation, not the Electoral College. Indeed, the discussions about the compromise and the discussions about the presidential election system were largely separate. The main reason the compromise is cited today is because, late in the convention, it was decided that each state\u2019s electoral vote allocation would match its congressional allocation.", "Overriding all these discussions is a much bigger compromise that was brokered between the large and small states: The large states agreed that representation in the Senate would be based on the principle of \u201cone state, one vote.\u201d The small states agreed that representation in the House of Representatives would be based on population.", "This blend between the two types of representation was later reflected in the Electoral College, which gives every state three electors, regardless of its size. The rest of the electors are allocated according to population.", "Critics of the Electoral College ignore the larger context of the three-fifths compromise, focusing instead on one statement made by Madison. Taken in isolation, it certainly sounds damning.", "\u201cThe right of suffrage,\u201d he told the convention in July, \u201cwas much more diffusive in the Northern than the Southern states; and the latter could have no influence in the election on the score of the negroes.\u201d", "Since Madison mentioned presidential electors in his very next sentence, Electoral College opponents contend that he was proposing such a system in order to increase Southern political power and to protect slavery.", "But Madison wasn\u2019t the first to suggest the use of electors that day. Rufus King of Massachusetts had already mentioned them. King was not in favor of slavery. To the contrary, he worked against it during his lifetime. William Paterson of New Jersey, another slavery opponent, also endorsed the concept of electors that day.", "The reality is that the discussion that day wasn\u2019t about slavery or the three-fifths compromise. Madison\u2019s statement was a tangent to the main discussion, which revolved around the president\u2019s eligibility for a second term of office. If the president were chosen by the legislature and also eligible for re-election, some delegates feared that he would end up working too hard to satisfy legislators.
